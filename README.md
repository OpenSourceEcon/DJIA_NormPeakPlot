# Normalized Peak Plot of Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
The code in this repository allows the user to create a normalized peak plot of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over the last 15 recessions, from the Great Depression (Aug. 1929 to Mar. 1933) to the most recent COVID-19 recession (Feb. 2020 to Apr. 2020). The dynamic version of this plot, which is updated regularly, is available to manipulate and explore at [https://www.oselab.org/gallery/djia_npp](https://www.oselab.org/gallery/djia_npp). The core maintainer of this repository is [Richard Evans](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon/) ([@RickEcon](https://github.com/rickecon)).

A normalized peak plot takes the maximum level of the DJIA at the beginning of a recession (within two months of the NBER declared beginning month) and normalizes the entire series so that the value at that peak equals 1.0. As such, the normalized time series shows the percent change from that peak. This is an intuitive way to compare the progression of average stock prices across recessions. The following figure is a screen shot of the normalized peak plot of the DJIA from Sep. 20, 2021.

This `README.md` is organized into the following three sections.
1. [Running the code and generating the dynamic visualization](README.md#1-running-the-code-and-generating-the-dynamic-visualization)
2. [Functionality of the dynamic visualization](README.md#2-functionality-of-the-dynamic-visualization)
3. [Contributing to this visualization code](README.md#3-contributing-to-this-visualization-code)

## 1. Running the code and generating the dynamic visualization
The code for creating this visualization is written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. It requires the following file:
* [`djia_npp_bokeh.py`](djia_npp_bokeh.py): a Python module that defines two functions in order to create the HTML and JavaScript for the dynamic visualization of the DJIA normalized peak plot of the last 15 recessions.
    * [`get_djia_data()`](djia_npp_bokeh.py#L30) takes inputs for the date ranges to plot and whether to download the data directly from [Stooq.com](https://stooq.com/) or retrieve the data from a file saved previously on your local hard drive in the [data](data/) directory of this repository. Then the function collects, cleans, and returns the DJIA data.
    * [`djia_npp()`](djia_npp_bokeh.py#L222) creates the dynamic visualization of the normalized peak plot of the DJIA over the last 15 recessions. This script calls the [`get_djia_data()`](djia_npp_bokeh.py#L30) function. It then uses the [`Bokeh`](https://bokeh.org/) library to create a dynamic visualization using HTML and JavaScript to render the visualization in a web browser.

The most standard way to successfully run this code if you are using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Python is to install and activate the `djia-npp-dev` [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) defined in the [environment.yml](environment.yml) file, then run the [`djia_npp_bokeh.py`](djia_npp_bokeh.py) module as a script with the defaults or import the [`djia_npp_bokeh.py`](djia_npp_bokeh.py) module and run the [`djia_npp()`](djia_npp_bokeh.py#L222) function using the appropriate options. Use the following steps.
1. Either fork this repository then clone it to your local hard drive or clone it directly to your local hard drive from this repository.
2. Install the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Python to your local machine.
3. Update `conda` and `anaconda` by opening your terminal and typing `conda update conda` and following the instructions, then typing `conda update anaconda` and following the instructions.
4. From the terminal (or Conda command prompt), navigate to the directory to which you cloned this repository and run `conda env create -f environment.yml`. This will create the conda environment with all the necessary dependencies to run the script to create the dynamic visualization.
5. Activate the conda environment by typing in your terminal `conda activate djia-npp-dev`.
6. Create the visualization in one of two ways.
    * Run the [`djia_npp_bokeh.py`](djia_npp_bokeh.py) module as a script with the default settings of the [`djia_npp()`](djia_npp_bokeh.py#L222) function. This will produce the dynamic visualization in which the data are downloaded from the internet, the end date is either the current day or the most recent day with DJIA closing data, and then the default months from peak.
    * Import the  [`djia_npp_bokeh.py`](djia_npp_bokeh.py) and execute the [`djia_npp()`](djia_npp_bokeh.py#L222) function by typing something like the following:
    ```python
    import djia_npp_bokeh as djia

    djia.djia_npp(12, 2, 24, 6, '2020-07-01')
    ```
7. Executing the function [`djia_npp()`](djia_npp_bokeh.py#L222) will result in three output objects: the dynamic visualization HTML file, the original time series of the DJIA, and the organized dataset of each recession's variables time series for the periods specified in the function inputs.
    * [**images/djia_npp_[YYYY-mm-dd].html**](images/djia_npp_2021-09-20.html). This is the dynamic visualization. The code in the file is a combination of HTML and JavaScript. You can view this visualization by opening the file in a web browser window. A version of this visualization is updated regularly on the web at [https://www.oselab.org/gallery/djia_npp](https://www.oselab.org/gallery/djia_npp).
    * [**data/djia_close_[YYYY-mm-dd].csv**](data/djia_close_2021-09-20.csv). A comma separated values data file of the original time series of the DJIA from 1896-05-27 to whatever end date is specified in the [`djia_npp()`](djia_npp_bokeh.py#L222) function arguments, which is also the final 10 characters of the file name `YYYY-mm-dd`.
    * [**data/djia_close_pk_[YYYY-mm-dd].csv**](data/djia_close_pk_2021-09-20.csv).

## 2. Functionality of the dynamic visualization
This dynamic visualization allows the user to customize some different views and manipulations of the data using the following functionalities. The default view of the visualization is shown above.
* Highlight or mute specific recession time series by clicking on the series label in the legend on the right side of the plot. The screen shot below shows a version of the plot in which all the recession time series have been muted except for the current COVID-19 recession and the Great Depression. Note that even when muted, the time series are still faintly visible.
